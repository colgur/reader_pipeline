Should use Google Reader API so there is no need for local feed store

Using NLTK to deliver the top words
   top phrase might be interesting but interaction would be more productive
   a tag cloud or heat map

So it goes like this now:
   1. Source Reader for certain feeds
   2. Produce a cloud of terms
   3. Click on term in cloud to view feed entries

Going to take the oldest feed file and update it
   Use a python list of objects corresponding to the most primitive RSS 2.0 feed:
      [((channel:title)([(item:title, item:link)]))]
   or hierarchally:
      channel:title
         item
            title
            link
         item
            title
            link
         ...

Could be a little more general and use sets:
   Oldest feed will be a subset of newer so we just pickle the union
